# tic-tac-toe

***

A simple tic-tac-toe-game made with vanilla js.

Playing against the computer you can choose difficulty. 
On easy the computer player plays randomly. On hard the computer play is based on the [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) decision rule.

Project was made as an exercise for the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript).

Enjoy!
